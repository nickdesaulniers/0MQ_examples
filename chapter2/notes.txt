Socket life cycles:

- Creating and destroying sockets
-- zmq_socket
-- zmq_close

- Configuring sockets by setting options on them and checking them if necessary
-- zmq_setsockopt
-- zmq_getsockopt

- Plugging sockets onto the network topology by creating zmq connections to and
  from them. The server calls bind, clients call connect.
-- zmq_bind
-- zmq_connect

- Using sockets to carry data by writing and receiving messages on them
-- zmq_msg_send
-- zmq_msg-recv
